Positron is an innovative project that provides a comprehensive Point of Sale (PoS) system with two main modules: Pos App and Invoice App. It is built using a powerful tech stack, including HTML5, Bootstrap 4, Spring Framework, Hibernate, Apache FOP, JPA, MySQL, Thymeleaf, and JavaScript. This versatile system is designed to streamline and enhance various retail operations, making it a perfect choice for businesses looking to modernize their point of sale experience.

## Features

### Product Master

### Inventory Management

### Invoice Generation Module

- Generate PDF invoices for customer orders.

- Operators cannot upload masters, manage inventory, or create orders.
- Supervisors have access to all API endpoints and functionalities.
